                <p>Everything started that hot summer evening. We were teenagers, dreaming to become someone in this world, when we randomly got intorduced to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media_marketing" target="_blank">SMMA</a>. That's when we figured out: This is the future. Our old computers and our ambitions were driving us crazy. Motivation, struggling and boy's dreams brought us to the place where we are today. To place where we belong.</p>

                <p>For first several months we could not get a client. But from reading business books and doing researches all day, we knew this would not be easy and straightforward. There was a lack of motivation that we needed to keep going. And luckily, it was in our minds. We knew we needed to keep struggling, because if it comes in a easy way, it would not be anything big.</p>
