Early Days
Everything started that hot summer evening. We were teenagers, dreaming to become someone in this world, when we randomly got intorduced to SMMA(link ka wikipediji). That's when we figured out: This is the future. Our old computers and our ambitions were driving us crazy. Motivation, struggling and boy's dreams brought us to the place where we are today. To place where we belong.
Rise
For a first several months we could not get a client. But from reading business books and doing researches all day, we knew this would not be easy and straightforward. There was a piece of motivation that we needed to keep going. And luckily, it was in our minds. We knew we needed to keep struggling, because if it was in a easy way, it would not be anything big.
Expansion
Investing costed us a ton of money. But investing in education, new laptops and other things are definitely paying off now.
Today
We are now a professional agency, doing thing that was hobby at first for a full-time job now. Using latest and most modern software to deliver our customers only the best pieces of our hard work.
